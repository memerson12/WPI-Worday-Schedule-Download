# WPI Workday Schedule Downloader

Tired of manually adding all of your courses to your calender? This Chrome extension simplifies the process by automatically downloading your Workday course schedule as an .ics file, which can be easily imported into popular calendar applications like iCalendar, Outlook, and Google Calendar.

**Note**: T**his extension has only been tested in Chrome** as such may not work in other browsers.

## Disclaimer

Workday is very silly in the way it works and as a result a couple of values in this extension are hard coded. If Workday changes how it works, it is very possible that this extension might break.

## Usage

To download your schedule, navigate to the `View My Courses` page or any of your saved schedules. From there simply click the `Download Schedule` Button.

## Installation

I have not taken the time to publish this to any of the extension web stores so the extension must be manually added to your browser.
